# Diabetes_prediction
Researchers examine data to comprehend the reasons of diabetes, a disease that affects a lot of people. To find out more about how these variables affect the chance of developing diabetes, the researchers use a dataset that contains data on age, body weight, blood pressure, heart health, smoking history, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level.
 
 # Analyse Results
 I obtained some impressive findings from my analysis:
Age is a known risk factor for diabetes, and persons over 40 are typically thought to be at increased risk. Smoking does not contribute to this condition.
- Diabetes may not have a direct cause other than heart disease or high blood pressure.
- BMI is only one type of body weight measurement, and it might not be the best sign of general health.

Just two factors, along with others like heart disease and hypertension, significantly contribute to this illness:
- HbA1c_level: the typical blood sugar level for the previous two to three months.
- The quantity of glucose in the blood is known as the blood glucose level.

# ML models

Finally, using the data I have, I develop a machine learning model with accuracy of 97% to aid in the early detection of this condition.
